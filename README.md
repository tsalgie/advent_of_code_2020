--- Day 3: [Toboggan Trajectory](https://github.com/tsalgie/advent_of_code_2020/blob/main/03/toboggan_trajectory.py) ---
- I think we only need to look at the data once for this

--- Day 4: [Passport Processing](https://github.com/tsalgie/advent_of_code_2020/blob/main/04/passport_processing.py) ---

--- Day 5: [Binary Boarding](https://github.com/tsalgie/advent_of_code_2020/blob/main/05/binary_boarding.py) ---
